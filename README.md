# VizualAge_Umod

This is the new home of VizualAge_Umod, a U-Pb geochronology data reduction scheme (DRS) for iolite 2/3 (www.iolite-software.com) written as a set of Igor Pro procedures. This DRS is used when reference materials and unknowns have different U isotope compositions.

# Requirements

1. Igor Pro 6.
2. Iolite 2.5 (i.e. freeware version) or 3+ (i.e. commercial version).
3. Probably depends on VizualAge (www.github.com/japetrus/VizualAge).

# Installation

1. Copy VizualAge_Umod.ipf to iolite's "Data Reduction Schemes" folder.
2. Restart iolite.

# Known problems

1. Probably isn't happy with Igor Pro 7. Hoping to fix soon.
